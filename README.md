# Linear Regression Model

In this project I have built a Linear Regression model. I have analysed the Insurance charges dataset for finding out the insurance price an individual would receive basing on different parameters. 

About the dataset:

The dataset contains 1338 rows where each row represents details about an individual and the following 7 columns:

1. Age - The age of the individual.
2. Sex - The gender of the individual whether "male" or "female".
3. BMI - The body mass index of the individual.
4. Children - The count shows how many children the individual has.
5. Smoker - Whether the person is a smoker or not [yes, no].
6. Region - Which region the person is a resident from [Nortwest, Norteast, Southwest, Southeast].
7. Charges - Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
