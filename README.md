# Linear Regression Model

In this project, I have built a Machine learning Linear Regression model. I have analysed the Insurance charges dataset to determine the insurance price based on different parameters. 


##Problem Statement:
Predict how much could be the insurance charges for a beneficiary based on the data provided using Linear Regression.


##About the dataset:

The dataset contains 1338 rows where each row represents details about an individual and the following 7 columns:

1. Age - The age of the individual.
2. Sex - The individual's gender whether "male" or "female".
3. BMI - The body mass index of the individual.
4. Children - The count shows how many children the individual has.
5. Smoker - Whether the person is a smoker or not [yes, no].
6. Region - The region the person resides in [Nortwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast].
7. Charges - Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
